# Real Password Generator
<h2> Welcome to Nashbi's Real Password Generator<h2> 
  <h4> This is the project that has catapulted my way of thinking and grew me to understand code in a different way. I now understand that Javascript is simply a programming language that equips you with tools to solve problems and or accomplish some really amazing things. Within this folder you will find a password generator that actually works! I created a function that will allow you to create a very unique password that no one will be able to guess. Feel free to explore its functions to the fullest. <h4>
